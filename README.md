# 🚢 Titanic Data Analysis - Portfolio Project  

### 📌 Overview  
This project explores survival patterns in the **Titanic dataset** using **Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib**.  
It includes **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations** to identify key survival factors.  

### 📂 Dataset  
This project uses the **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle. You can download it here:  
🔗 [Titanic Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)  

After downloading, place the `train.csv` file in the same directory as the notebook.

### 📊 Key Insights  
✔ **Women had a much higher survival rate (74%) than men (19%)**  
✔ **First-class passengers had the highest survival rate (~63%)**  
✔ **Children (0-12) had the highest age-group survival rate (~58%)**  
✔ **Passengers with higher fares had better survival chances**  

### 🛠️ Tools Used  
- **Python** (`pandas`, `numpy`) for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for organizing and presenting the analysis  

### 🚀 Future Work  
✅ Feature Engineering (e.g., extract titles from names)  
✅ Machine Learning Model for survival prediction  
✅ Interactive Dashboard using Tableau or Plotly
